/*******************************************************************************
 * The dreaded "Visitor Pattern" is a hack that makes it possible for someone to
 * add new behaviors to an existing class hierarchy. It works by defining a 
 * method called `accept`, for all the classes in the hierarchy. This method 
 * takes an argument called `behavior` that is essentially a 
 * functional-programming implementation of the behavior. In other words, 
 * `behavior` will provide a way to call a function that defines the new 
 * behavior by pattern-matching on the kind of data passed into the function.
